# Stock Prediction with AI Chatbot



An AI-powered project that predicts stock prices and answers your questions via an interactive chatbot.  
Making stock analysis simple, smart, and accessible!

---

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

The stock market is complex, data-driven, and fast-changing, which makes it difficult for individual investors to make informed decisions.

To solve this, the project combines:
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Trains predictive models on historical stock data to forecast future prices.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create a chatbot that understands and answers user questions about predictions.
- **Docker:** Ensures consistent development, testing, and deployment environments by containerizing the entire application, so it can run anywhere without dependency issues.

By bringing these technologies together, the project simplifies stock analysis and makes powerful prediction tools accessible to everyoneâ€”even without technical knowledge.
